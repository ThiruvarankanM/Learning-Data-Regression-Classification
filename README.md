# EN3150 Assignment 02: Learning from Data and Related Challenges

This project explores key concepts in regression and classification as part of the EN3150 Pattern Recognition course at the University of Moratuwa, Department of Electrical Engineering.

The assignment covers:
- Theoretical and practical aspects of linear and logistic regression
- Implementation and comparison of optimization methods (gradient descent, Newton's method)
- Analysis of feature scaling, solver performance, and data preprocessing
- Mathematical explanations and critical discussion of results

The work demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to real-world and synthetic datasets, with a focus on clear reasoning, reproducibility, and academic integrity.
